			<h1>History</h1>
			<p>The name `Sonitpur' as well as Tezpur literally means "the city of blood". It reminds of the romantic legend of Usha and Anirudha. The legend revolves around Banasura, the great Asura king of ancient Tezpur, his beautiful daughter Usha and her friend Chitralekha. The Assam town of Dhekiajuli has decided to honour Tileswari Barua, who was shot at the age of 12 by the British on September 20, 1942, during the Quit India Movement when she and some freedom fighters tried to unfurl the Tricolour atop a police station. has an average elevation of 100 metres (328 ft). There are several tea estates in its vicinity. Some of the major ones include Sapoi, Julia, Dibru-Darrang, Tinkhuria and Deckiajuli TE,Panbari TE run by Kanoi Groups of Companies) etc. Orang National Park is 31.7 km west of the main town of Dhekiajuli. The river Brahmaputra crosses the town. This temple has been mentioned in the Kalikapuran as Shringatak.. It is said that one can attain penance worshipping it. As the Shiva Linga of this temple revered as God remains under water, the temple is also known as Gupteshwar. Derived from the word "Gupta" which means hidden and "Eshwar" denotes God.As mentioned by the great master Jigme Lingpa in the 18th century, Singri has been the pilgrimage site for Tibetans and Bhutanese, since the 14th century. The Angigrah Legend has it that this fortress was surrounded by fire at all times so that nobody could go in or out of the perimeter without permission. Usha fell in love with Aniruddha in her dreams, not knowing that he was the grandson of Krishna. Her companion Chitralekha identified him by painting his portrait from Usha's description. Chitralekha Udyan in Tezpur also known as 'Cole Park,' the biggest park in Tezpur, is named after her. Chitralekha was not only an artist but one possed with mystical powers. Anirudddha was Krishna's grandson and Usha, the daughter of an Asura king, therefore was no way any side would consent to their love. She flew one night and brought Aniruddha to Usha's place while he was still sleeping, using her powers. When Aniruddha opened his eyes and saw Usha, he fell in love immediately. However, Banasura was furious on knowing this, and tied him with snakes and imprisoned him. Lord Krishna, however had agreed for their marriage and had wanted for Banasura to consent for the same. Banasura was a great devotee of Lord Shiva, and as a boon had asked him and his entire family to guard the gates of his city, Tezpur. He therefore was not at all scared by Lord Krishna's wrath. A war ensued between the Hari (Lord Krishna and his followers) and the Hars (Lord Shiva and his followers), rivers of blood flowed and the city was named Tezpur (City of Blood). Both sides were nearly wiped out and a final battle followed between Lord Shiva and Lord Krishna, Lord Brahma requested both of them to stop the war by putting him between them. A discussion followed in which Lord Krishna made Lord Shiva see that Banasura was acting wrongly in imprisoning his grandson, and had even disrespected Lord Shiva himself in asking him and his family to be his gate keepers. Lord Shiva agreed, and Banasura was brought. Fearing his life he immediately agreed to the marriage.
