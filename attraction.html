	<h2>Attraction Point</h2>
      <p>Located north of the river of Brahmaputra, Amingoan is one of the distant districts of Assam. It is more of a small town that has been backward in comparison to the neighboring cities and towns. Tourism, hence, recently started here and it developed as a travel destination mostly because it proved to be the best getaway for those who want some quiet time away from the hustle and bustle of cities. Dhemaji has Arunachal Himalayas as a northern background which is a beautiful sight to behold.An Insight into Dhemaji Tourism
Once you’re on your tour in Dhemaji, one of the top things to do is to visit Gerukamukh, which is the most treasured place. Gerukamukha is the largest tributary of Brahmaputra River. It is wondrously exquisite with its beauty and poise and has become a popular place for having picnics and enjoying angling with friends and family. Ghuguha Dol has a legendary myth attached to its existence. It is strongly believed that the Ahom King, Tyao Khamti’s son, Bamuni Konwar had taken his first breath within the walls of this very temple.Once you’re on your tour in Dhemaji, one of the top things to do is to visit Gerukamukh, which is the most treasured place.

This temple had been built by Bamuni Konwar himself as an honorary tribute to his loving mother. A bit far away lies the Malini Than, which is believed to have been a hotspot for worshipping the Goddess Malini.</p>
